Feature: Updating listeners

  Here's an overview of the entire process:

    1. ask the serial device for the number of projects it is tracking
    2. for each project:
       1. ask the serial device for its codefumes.com authentication information
       2. get the project's build status from codefumes.com
       3. send the status to the serial device

  Scenario: sending the project's build status
    Given there are projects with the following public keys set up at Codefumes.com:
      | public_key |
      | aBcd       |
      | eFGh       |
      | iJKL       |
    And the projects have the following build statuses:
      | public_key | build_status |
      | aBcd       | running      |
      | eFGh       | passing      |
      | iJKL       | failed       |
    And the projects are removed
    And the projects are all being tracked on the serial device
    When I run update_listeners
    Then it passes the following update messages to the serial device:
      | message |
      | stuff1  |
      | stuff2  |
      | stuff3  |
